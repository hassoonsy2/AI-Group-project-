## Recommendation Engine 

A recommendation engine is a system that suggests products, services, information to users based on analysis of data. Notwithstanding, the recommendation can derive from a variety of factors such as the history of the user and the behaviour of similar users.
Recommendation systems are quickly becoming the primary way for users to expose to the whole digital world through the lens of their experiences, behaviours, preferences and interests. And in a world of information density and product overload, a recommendation engine provides an efficient way for companies to provide consumers with personalised information and solutions.
